        <p> The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by nuclear 
            fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared 
            radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth. </p>
