                Sun, star around which Earth and the other components of the solar system revolve. It is the dominant body of the system, constituting more than 99 percent of its entire mass. The Sun is the source of an enormous amount of energy, a portion of which provides Earth with the light and heat necessary to support life. </p>

                The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km, about 30 times the planet's diameter. It always faces Earth with its near side, being tidally locked to Earth. This results in the lunar month of 29.5 days matching the lunar day. </p>
